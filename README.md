# GHC artifacts container generated to build cardano 🐳
Cardano docker is can now be supported as container a in Raspberry Pi or AWS Gravitron container platform.
It is based in ubuntu focal builder in a documented and formal way (supply chain review).

Access to the multi-platform docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/juampe/base-ghc).
Access to the Git [repository](https://github.com/juampe/base-ghc)

It is based in cabal [repository](https://github.com/juampe/base-cabal) artifacts.

# Minimize supply chain attack. 🔗
You can supervise all the sources, all the build steps, build yourserlf.
# Multi-platform image 👪
Supported platforms:

* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64
* linux/riscv64

# A complex building proccess recipe to build cardano. 🔥
We are working very hard, to bring this container. The building process in quemu arm64 is huge (20 times slower).
Please undestand that this is an "spartan race" building process due to qemu limitations.
We planned to made in 3 phases:
* Phase 1 Build Cabal 3.2.0.0 free of OFD Locking
 * Build with Github action in 12896s
 * Build with amd64 12VCPU 32GMEM 50GSSD in 7045s
* Phase 2 Build ghc 8.10.2 compatible with state-of-the-art qemu for multi architecture CI/CD
 * Unable to use Github action due to service limitations
 * Build with amd64 12VCPU 32GMEM 50GSSD in 26513s
* Phase 3 Bulid Cardano 1.25.1
 * Unable to use Github action due to service limitations
 * Unable to use qemu with amd64 due to ghc-pkg OFD hLock 
 * Build with arm64v8 Gravitron
